(completed above) Define a function, as a function declaration, maxOfTwoNumbersthat takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. If they are the same, return that number. Use the if-else construct or a ternary expression - the Math.max method is not allowed.
Define a function, as a function expression, maxOfThreethat takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Again, the Math.max method is not allowed.
Define a function, as a function declaration, isCharAVowelthat takes a character as an argument and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.
Define a function, as a function expression, sumArraythat takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers. For example, sumArray([2, 4, 5]);would return 11.
Define a function, as a function declaration, multiplyArraythat takes an array of numbers and returns the product those numbers. For example, multiplyArray([2, 4, 5]);would return 40.
Define a function, as a function expression, numArgsthat returns the number of arguments passed to the function when called.
Define a function, as a function declaration, reverseStringthat takes a string, reverses the characters, and returns it. For example, reverseString('rockstar');would return the string "ratskcor".
Define a function, as a function expression, longestStringInArraythat takes an array of strings as an argument and returns the length of the longest string.
Define a function, as a function declaration, stringsLongerThanthat takes an array of strings and a number as arguments; and returns an array of the strings that are longer than the number passed in. For example, stringsLongerThan(['say', 'hello', 'in', 'the', 'morning'], 3);would return ["hello", "morning"].
